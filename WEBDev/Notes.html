-------------------------------- Section 5 -- Intermediate CSS ----------------------------------------------



-- We can use 'line-height' to change the spacing between the text lines

-- text-decoration : none   --> removes the underline from anchor element

-- <link rel="icon" href="sadsdfs">    --- this code in the head tag will set the icon of the page title


------------------------ HTML DIVS ---------------------

Divs dont do anything unless we use CSS with it.

div = content division element

it groups number of elements together

<div>

</div>

---------------------- BOX MODEL OF WEBSITE STYILING ---------------------

{width : 600px;}
{height : 100px;}
border : solid;
padding             Space between content and border of the element
margin              Space between the neighbouring element



----------------------- CSS DISPLAY PROPERTY ---------------------

Display has 4 different values:

Block;
Inline;
Inline-Block;
None;

NOTE- We can change the width the Block Display and we cannot change the width with Inline Display


-->Common Block Display Elements: (PHDLF)

By default some elements are called block display, Block Elements take the whole width on the display
essentially blocking other elements but height is decided by the content

Paragraphs(<p>)
Headers(<h></h>)
Divisions(<div></div>)
List and List Items(<ol></ol>, <ul></ul>, <li></li>)
Forms(<form></form>)

-->Common Inline Display Elements: (SIA)

Inline Elements only take as much space as needed and do not block other elements from being at the side

Con -  we can't actually change the width of a span element

Span (<span></span>)
Images (<img>)
Anchor (<a></a>)


--> Inline-Block 

We can change the display property of a block element to Inline-Block and Vice-Versa

p{
    display : Inline-Block;
}



--> None


WE use display:None to remove the element from the display i.e to hide it

also we can use "visibility:hidden;" its like it will become invisible but still 
act like a normal element as in it will still take space



----------------------- CSS STATIC AND RELATIVE POSITIONING ---------------------

--> Understanding Default POSITIONING

1. Content is Everything

2. Order of the display of elements comes from the Code

3. Children Sit on top of parents

<div>
    <h1>
        a <span>
            pro
        </span>
        grammer
    </h1>
</div>


position : fixed, absolute, relative, static  (FARS)


---> Changing the Position Property to our will instead of using the Default

 1. STATIC

 
 All Html elements are static in their position by default


 2. RELATIVE

It measures the distance from the edges of the element
or its position is relative to the static position 

img{
    position : relative;
    left : 30px;        -->give this image 30 px of space from the left of its static position
    right : 30px;       -->give this image 30 px of space from the right of its static position
    top : 30px;         -->give this image 30 px of space from the top of its static position
    bottom : 30px;      -->give this image 30 px of space from the bottom of its static position
}

This does not the effect the position of any other elements

It can even be used to overplap other elements

 3. ABSOLUTE

 When we use Absolute positioning we are actually taking it out of the flow

Its position is accordingly relative to the Parent 
 
Here the other elements position do get effected

Below the div is the parent of img

div{
    position : relative;
}

img{
    position : absolute;
    left : 30px;        -->give this image 30 px of space from the left of the parent
    right : 30px;       -->give this image 30 px of space from the right of the parent
    top : 30px;         -->give this image 30 px of space from the top of the parent
    bottom : 30px;      -->give this image 30 px of space from the bottom of the parent
}


NOTE - if the parents position is not set to Relative then the childs position will be relative to the BODY
 

 4. FIXED

position : fixed ;

this fixes the element to the page as we scroll the page




---> Dark Art of Centering Elements with CSS

To center elements use TEXT ALIGN property of the PARENT Container

body{
    text-align : center;
}

h1{
    margin : 0 auto 0 auto;  --> This sets Left = 0, Top  = auto, Right = 0, Bottom = auto;
    margin : 0 auto;         --> This set Top = Bottom = 0 , Left = Right = auto;
}       
 
If its a Parent Element use Text-Align and for a Block Element with Width u have to use 
margin as per above



--> Font Styling

 using the link from the font.google we are embedding it so it will work even if people dont have it.

Use font.google.com for free fonts


---> CSS Sizing

font size = 16px = 100% = 1em = 1rem

use rem as it is the most adaptable and reliable of them all

inherits value from the parent

em and % sizes do scale up as per the size of the page and px does not

rem - root em , it does not get affected by the inherited value of the parent


--> CSS Float and Clear

float : left  --> Makes the element float to the left of the parent and wrap the elements to its right

clear : right --> its like anti - float

float has many corner cases so only use it for wrapping TEXT around a certain element and dont use it for positioning





-------------------------------- Section 6 -- Bootstrap   ----------------------------------------------

Bootstrap makes it easy to make the website layout fit on Mobile, Desktop and Tablets

It has Pre-Styled Elements for us to drop on the code
