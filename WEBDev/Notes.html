------------------------ HTML DIVS ---------------------

Divs dont do anything unless we use CSS with it.

div = content division element

it groups number of elements together

<div>

</div>

---------------------- BOX MODEL OF WEBSITE STYILING ---------------------

{width : 600px;}
{height : 100px;}
border : solid;
padding             Space between content and border of the element
margin              Space between the neighbouring element

----------------------- CSS DISPLAY PROPERTY ---------------------

Display has 4 different values:

Block;
Inline;
Inline-Block;
None;

NOTE- We can change the width the Block Display and we cannot change the width with Inline Dislay


-->Common Block Display Elements:

By default some elements are calle block display, Block Elements take the whole width on the display
essentially blocking other elements but height is decided by the content

Paragraphs(<p>)
Headers(<h></h>)
Divisions(<div></div>)
List and List Items(<ol></ol>, <ul></ul>, <li></li>)
Forms(<form></form>)

-->Common Inline Display Elements:

Inline Elements only take as much space as needed and do not block other elements from being at the side

Con -  we cant actually change the width of a span element

Span (<span></span>)
Images (<img>)
Anchor (<a></a>)


--> Inline-Block 

We can change the display property of a block element to Inline-Block and Vice-Versa

p{
    display : Inline-Block;
}



--> None


WE use display:None to remove the element from the display i.e to hide it

also we can use "visibility:hidden;" its like it will become invisible but still 
act like a normal element as in it will still take space



----------------------- CSS STATIC AND RELATIVE POSITIONING ---------------------

--> Understanding Default POSITIONING

1. Content is Everything

2. Order of the display of elements comes from the Code

3. Children Sit on top of parents

<div>
    <h1>
        a <span>
            pro
        </span>
        grammer
    </h1>
</div>


---> Changing the Positionj Property to our will instead of using the Default

 1. STATIC

 
 All Html elements are static in their position by default


 2. RELATIVE

It measure the distance from the edges of the element

img{
    position : relative;
    left : 30px;        -->give this image 30 px of space from the left
    right : 30px;       -->give this image 30 px of space from the right
    top : 30px;         -->give this image 30 px of space from the top
    bottom : 30px;      -->give this image 30 px of space from the bottom
}

This does not the effect the position of any other elements

It can even be used to overplap other elements

 3. ABSOLUTE

Its position is accordingly relative to the Parent 
 
Here the other elements position does get effected

img{
    position : absolute;
    left : 30px;        -->give this image 30 px of space from the left of the parent
    right : 30px;       -->give this image 30 px of space from the right of the parent
    top : 30px;         -->give this image 30 px of space from the top of the parent
    bottom : 30px;      -->give this image 30 px of space from the bottom of the parent
}



 
 4. FIXED

position : fixed ;

this fixes the element to the page as we scroll the page




---> Dark Art of Centering Elements with CSS

To center elements use TEXT ALIGN property of the PARENT Container

body{
    text-align : center;
}

h1{
    margin : 0 auto 0 auto;  --> This sets Left = 0, Top  = auto, Right = 0, Bottom = auto;
}       

If its a Parent Element use Text-Align and for a Block Element with Width u have to use 
margin as per above
